"""Read per-cell 3D volume statistics for a track and join them to its history.

The ``cell_volume_stats`` enrichment table lives in the same ``catalog.db`` as
the track tables but is keyed separately (run_id, scan_time, cell_uid). The live
dashboard's time-series panels read ``cells_by_scan`` only, so volume columns
(e.g. cloud-top height) must be joined on demand when a volume plot group is
selected. This module owns that read + join — no Tk, no matplotlib.
