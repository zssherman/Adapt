"""Ingress source contract.

A source is the pipeline's ingress role: it produces a stream of scan file paths
(from the cloud, a local directory, a watched folder, …) and pushes them into the
processor queue. It is NOT a graph transform — it has no upstream context and it
drives the loop rather than being pulled by it.

This Protocol is structural: a source need not import or subclass anything to
qualify (which keeps acquisition modules free of runtime imports). It documents
the methods the orchestrator depends on.
